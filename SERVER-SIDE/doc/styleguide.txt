Security and Privacy
====================

Please keep in mind that the entire Git repository is Internet accessible
(read-only over HTTP) with no authentication.  Any secret information,
especially passwords and private keys, should be kept out of the repository,
and should probably be handled using the FAI key exchange web server or
CFengine instead.


FAI vs. CFengine
================

TODO: Describe how to divide the responsibilities between FAI and CFengine.


Our Classes
===========

DEFAULT         The first class of every FAI invocation
LINUX           The second class of every FAI invocation (from `uname -s`)
AMD64 I386      Installation architecture (maybe different from the hardware)
FAICD           FAI is running from an ISO image

I386_BIGMEM     I386 with > 4 GiB RAM, which could benefit from PAE kernel

VZ_CONTAINER    Installing to an OpenVZ container
NOT_VZ_CONTAINER ... or not

VM_GUEST        Installing to a virtual machine
