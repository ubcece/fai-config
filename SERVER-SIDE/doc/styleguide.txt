Security and Privacy
====================

Please keep in mind that the entire Git repository is Internet accessible
(read-only over HTTP) with no authentication.  Any secret information,
especially passwords and private keys, should be kept out of the repository,
and should probably be handled using the FAI key exchange web server or
CFengine instead.


FAI vs. CFengine
================

TODO: Describe how to divide the responsibilities between FAI and CFengine.


Our Classes
===========

DEFAULT         The first class of every FAI invocation
LINUX           The second class of every FAI invocation (from `uname -s`)
AMD64 I386      Installation architecture (maybe different from the hardware)
FAICD           FAI is running from an ISO image

I386_BIGMEM     I386 with > 4 GiB RAM, which could benefit from PAE kernel

VZ_CONTAINER    Installing to an OpenVZ container
NOT_VZ_CONTAINER ... or not

VM_GUEST        Installing to a virtual machine
BOCHS_GUEST      ... KVM virtual machine
VMWARE_GUEST     ... VMWare virtual machine

==

FAIBASE         TODO: How is this different from DEFAULT and LINUX?
DHCPC           If FAIBASE, configure eth0 to use DHCP, not static IP address

ECE             TODO: Seems to do nothing?

DISK2           Machine with 2 disks; FAI will install to second disk
RAID            RAID1 using Linux md

SERVER          TODO: UTC, LVM snapshot space
LOOKUPSERVER    BIND, DHCP, LDAP, NIS, NTP, VertXd server (no NFS support)
SMBSERVER       Samba server with LDAP utilities
MAIL            Mail server (SMTP, IMAP, and/or mailing list)

GNOME           Install GNOME desktop environment
KDE             Install KDE desktop environment

NET             Routing/bridging/firewalling/VPN server

WEBGOAT         Java Servlet server (misnomer since WebGoat is not installed)

OMNI            General-purpose workstation with lots of packages

SLOW            Long pauses before risky operations
==

GRUB2           Install GRUB2 bootloader

DEBIAN          The recommended version of Debian
UBUNTU          The recommended version of Ubuntu
SQBPO           Use kernel from squeeze-backports, nVidia software from testing
SQUEEZE         Debian 6
UBUNTU_14_04    Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty)

The disk configurations below should be automatically inferred by
class/80-disk, not explicitly specified.  The selection of the disk
partitioning scheme is influenced by the number and size of disks, as well as
classes DISK2, RAID, VM_GUEST, and VM_HOST.

VM_GUEST        VM guest, using LVM names established by UBC IT Systems
VM_GUEST2       VM guest as above, with a data volume group on a second disk
VM_HOST         Proxmox host, with a large /var/lib/vz logical volume
SMALL           disk < 40 GB
MEDIUM          40 GB <= disk < 100 GB
MEDIUM2         40 GB <= disk < 100 GB, on disk 2 for dual boot
LARGE           100 GB <= disk
LARGE2          100 GB <= disk, on disk 2 for dual boot
RAID1           100 GB <= disk, using disks 1 and 2 in Linux RAID 1

HP_ILO          HP Integrated Lights-Out Management present
HP_ILO_REV1      ... rev 1
HP_ILO_REV3      ... rev 3
HP_ILO_REV4      ... rev 4

MPT_SCSI        SCSI card present: LSI Logic Fusion-MPT
AIC79XX         Hardware RAID card present: Adaptec AIC-79XX

LAST            The last class of every FAI invocation
