Security and Privacy
====================

Please keep in mind that the entire Git repository is Internet accessible
(read-only over HTTP) with no authentication.  Any secret information,
especially passwords and private keys, should be kept out of the repository,
and should probably be handled using the FAI key exchange web server or
CFengine instead.


FAI vs. CFengine
================

TODO: Describe how to divide the responsibilities between FAI and CFengine.

Exactly one of the following disk-partitioning schemes shall be inferred by
class/80-disk, with the choice influenced by the number and size of disks, as
well as classes DISK2, RAID, VM_GUEST, and VM_HOST.

VM_GUEST        VM guest, using LVM names established by UBC IT Systems
VM_GUEST2       VM guest as above, with a data volume group on a second disk
VM_HOST         Proxmox host, with a large /var/lib/vz logical volume
SMALL           disk < 40 GB
MEDIUM          40 GB <= disk < 100 GB
MEDIUM2         40 GB <= disk < 100 GB, FAI on disk 2 for dual boot
LARGE           100 GB <= disk
LARGE2          100 GB <= disk, FAI on disk 2 for dual boot
RAID1           100 GB <= disk, using disks 1 and 2 in Linux RAID 1
