Run FAI From PXE
================

To run FAI from PXE (Preboot Execution Environment), the machine to be
installed needs to be configured to attempt to boot from the network before
booting from local media.  The PXE server needs to have a PXELINUX boot menu
associated with that machine that loads the FAI kernel and initrd with the
appropriate boot parameters.

The easiest way to put that boot menu in place is to use the
SERVER-SIDE/bin/fai-pxe command.  A typical invocation might be:

    1 $ SERVER-SIDE/bin/fai-pxe -t install-squeeze bofh

Run FAI dirinstall

FAI on a Macintosh
==================

Macintosh computers do not support PXE protocol; they use their own Boot
Server Discovery Protocol (BSDP) instead.  Although it is possible to
configure a DHCP server to support the BSDP extensions to DHCP, it is unclear
if it is possible to package a Linux kernel in a way that it can be booted
using BSDP.  To install Linux on a Mac, you could try booting to a USB stick
containing the FAI NFS root.  A more challenging approach might be to write an
FAI kernel, initrd, GRUB2 EFI bootloader, and a GRUB2 configuration to the EFI
partition.
