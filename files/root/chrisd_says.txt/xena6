# Update as of 2008-01-22. The comment regarding grub may no longer be true.
As is typical for machines installed with the now-archaic seperate /boot
partition, grub doesn't correctly set the root drive in menu.lst. Change 
from # groot=(hd1,1)
  to # groot=(hd1,0)

After editing run update-grub. 

Setting a grub password is one step in securing machines located in
unsecure areas.

Since xena6 has non-standard disk partitions matlab had to be installed in
/usr/local instead of /opt. I lightly edited matlab-bash and ran it.

find / -xdev -uid 4294967294 will find files owned by (nfs4)nobody. chown as
appropriate. This is really a fai script error on my part.
