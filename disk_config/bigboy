# Use setup-storage, not setup_harddisks

# 2009-07-10 ChrisD. Now using this for hct1, wankel as well as stabile. bigboy was
# renamed stabile.debian.org.

# 2009-05-20 ChrisD. The /dev/sdXX device assigned to each disk on bigboy
# should be considered volatile. E.g. if kernel module 3w_9xxx is inserted
# before sata_nv then the 160GB Samsung drive might be /dev/sdao instead of
# /dev/sda. For that reason use UUID's.
# Addendum: in order to work around a GRUB limitation:
# http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=514967 
# bigboy *must* have sata_nv loaded before 3w_9xxx. Then,  the 160GB Samsung is
# /dev/sda and the 160GB Seagate is /dev/sdb.
