# Volume groups are named "host" and "hostdata" rather than "vg" and "data"
# in case you want to manually loopback-mount a KVM guest's raw disk image
# using kpartx.  You don't want the guest and the host's volume group names
# to collide, as that would cause confusion.

# If the /var/lib/vz filesystem is not ext[234] then disk quotas will not work
# in OpenVZ containers.  http://wiki.openvz.org/Disk_quota
# Also, ext4 can have very poor fsync performance compared to ext3.
#
# Finally, ext3 does not enable write barriers by default.  Write barriers help
# prevent filesystem corruption in case of power loss.  Barriers may be
# disabled if the disk has battery backup.
