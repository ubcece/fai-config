# This disk_config is suitable for a workstation with >70GB and <2TB hard disk

# In FAI 3.2.17, setup-storage has a bug: if an LVM volume group already
# exists, running setup-storage a second time causes an error:
# "Cannot satisfy pre-depends for vgreduce vg /dev/.... -- system left untouched."
# A workaround is to first run "/sbin/vgremove some_vg_name". Done in hooks/partition.GRUB2

# 2010-10-04 Chris Dumont. Another limitation of FAI 3.2.17 is that
# setup-storage can't set the partiion flags. See scripts/GRUB2/10-setup
# A bit of a fib: the "bootable:3" option. GPT doesn't have bootable flags. But
# we use it to fool setup-storage into correctly setting BOOT_DEVICE (to
# /dev/sda). Otherwise setup-storage defaults to incorrectly setting
# BOOT_DEVICE to the same as BOOT_PARTITION (to /dev/mapper/vg-root1).

# The 200M partition is for gpt's sake. Somewhat like the old way of having a
# separate /boot but for quite different reasons.
