# Package lists are primarily grouped by the OS release, then by feature.
# However, since the only way in FAI to specify that a package should be
# installed only when CLASS_A and CLASS_B both applicable is to create a file
# CLASS_A that contains a "PACKAGES install CLASS_B" section.  So, here are
# some exceptions...

PACKAGES install AMD64
libc6-dev-i386

PACKAGES install VIRTUALBOX_GUEST
virtualbox-guest-x11
