# task_setup() sets the clock from a time server, but does not commit it to
# the hardware clock, so after rebooting, it can forget the time and cause
# cfengine to fail.  Therefore, we write to the hardware clock in the hook
# for the instsoft task, which runs after the setup task, but does not run
# in rescue mode.
