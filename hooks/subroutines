# FAI executes these default tasks in the following order:
#   confdir     Mount or obtain the $FAI configuration directory
#   setup       Set clock, define $FAI_FLAGS, start VTs, start sshd
#   defclass    Define classes
#   defvar      Source $FAI/$class/*.var and /tmp/fai/additional.var
#   action      Decide action - sysinfo, install, softupdate, or custom action
#   sysinfo     If action=sysinfo, show hardware info, mount /target readonly
#   install     If action=install, 3 beeps, call tasks partition...savelog
#   dirinstall  If action=dirinstall, call tasks extrbase...finish, savelog
#   softupdate  If action=softupdate, update an existing installation
#
#   partition   Run setup-storage, write /tmp/fai/disk_var.sh and fstab
#   mountdisks  Mount partitions using /tmp/fai/fstab relative to $FAI_ROOT
#   extrbase    Run debootstrap (use /var/tmp/base.tgz as a shortcut)
#   mirror      If $FAI_DEBMIRROR is NFS, mount it to $MNTPOINT
#   debconf     Fill debconf database by running `fai-debconf $FAI/debconf`
#   prepareapt  Set up resolv.conf and other files for the next task updatebase
#   updatebase  Mount /proc et al, make diversions, apt-key add, apt-get update
#   instsoft    Install packages as directed by $FAI/package_config
#   configure   Call scripts in $FAI/scripts/ and subdirectories
#   tests       Call scripts in $FAI/tests/ and subdirectories
#   finish      Unmount target filesystems, undo fai-divert diversions
#   chboot      Execute fai-chboot on the server
#   savelog     Copy local logs to account $LOGUSER on $LOGSERVER
#
#   faiend      Wait for bg jobs to finish, reboot if appropriate
#
# Most hooks are called before the task of the same name.  This file,
# $FAI/hooks/subroutines, is a special case.  It is called after the confdir
# task, which is the earliest opportunity for the contents of the $FAI
# configuration directory to influence anything.
#
# In addition to completing the establishment of the $FAI configuration
# directory, you can define and override FAI builtin functions here.
#
# Since this file is sourced by bash rather than executed, please take care to
# avoid introducing unintentional side effects.  A good convention to follow
# would be to wrap as much functionality as possible in shell functions with
# local variables.  The shell functions should be named ece_something() to
# distinguish them from FAI builtin functions.
