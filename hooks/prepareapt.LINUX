# FAI's prepareapt task does some unnecessary and harmful things.  For example,
# it copies /etc/apt/sources.list from the root filesystem to the target
# filesystem, which is the wrong thing to do for dirinstall.

# Suppress the prepareapt task
. /usr/lib/fai/subroutines
skiptask prepareapt

# Just do the minimum needed work ourselves
fcopy -iBM /etc/apt/sources.list
