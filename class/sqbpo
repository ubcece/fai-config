# List of hosts for which we want Squeeze Backport. As of 2011-05-10 a backport
# kernel is necessary for hardware too new for the 2.6.32 kernel. OTOH, since
# the backports repository is missing a few packages I don't want to use 2.6.38
# everywhere, yet.

# One hostname per line and they must be bare (no comment, no whitespace).
